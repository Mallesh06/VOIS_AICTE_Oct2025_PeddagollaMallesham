## Overview  
This project analyzes open Airbnb data to extract insights about listings, pricing patterns, host behavior, and relationships between various features (e.g. location, availability, reviews). The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (`Airbnb_Open_Data.ipynb`).  

The goal is to build an understanding of what drives listing performance, identify trends, and potentially develop predictive models (if applicable).

## Objectives  
- Clean, preprocess, and explore Airbnb listing datasets.  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find trends, correlations, and anomalies.  
- Visualize key metrics (price distribution, availability, review counts, etc.).  
- If applicable, build a model to predict price or occupancy, or cluster similar listings.  
- Summarize findings and make recommendations.  

## Data Description  
- **Source**: (mention where you obtained the Airbnb datasets)  
- **Contents**: The data includes e.g. listing information, host details, review stats, availability calendars, prices, etc.  
- **Key features / columns**:  
  - `listing_id` / `id`  
  - `host_id`, `host_name`  
  - `neighborhood`, `city`, `latitude`, `longitude`  
  - `price`, `minimum_nights`, `availability_365`  
  - `number_of_reviews`, `review_scores_rating`  
  - etc.  

Mention any filtering, cleaning, or feature engineering you did (e.g. handling missing values, converting price strings to numeric, deriving new columns).

## Methodology / Approach  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Type conversions  
   - Feature engineering (e.g. extracting neighbourhood groups, average reviews per month)  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution plots (price, reviews, availability)  
   - Correlation analysis (heatmaps, scatter plots)  
   - Geographic plots (mapping listings on map)  
   - Identifying outliers  
3. **Modeling / Advanced Analysis** *(if included)*  
   - Regression / Machine Learning to predict price or demand  
   - Clustering / segmentation of listings  
4. **Interpretation & Insights**  
   - What features most influence price  
   - Patterns by location, seasonality, host type  
   - Recommendations for hosts / platform  

## Setup & Requirements  

You will need:

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter / JupyterLab  
- Key Python packages (you can provide a `requirements.txt`):  
  ```text
  numpy  
  pandas  
  matplotlib  
  seaborn  
  plotly  
  scikit-learn  
  folium / geopandas (if mapping)

To install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage / How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mallesh06/VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_PeddagollaMallesham.git
cd VOIS_AICTE_Oct2025_PeddagollaMallesham


2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment.


3. Install dependencies as above.


4. Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Airbnb_Open_Data.ipynb


5. Follow the notebook cell by cell:

Load data

Clean / preprocess

Run EDA and visualizations

(If applicable) Run modeling cells



6. Export results / charts / report.

## Results & Insights

Listings in central neighborhoods command 25–35% higher average prices.

A strong positive correlation (~0.6) between number of reviews and price (after controlling for location).

Many listings have high availability but low occupancy (indicating under-utilization).

The regression model achieved RMSE ~ $X on test set.

Clustering reveals 3 distinct host types: luxury, budget, medium-tier.


Include a few sample visualizations (if possible) or refer to output charts in the notebook.

## Conclusion

Summarize what your project achieved, what insights are valuable, and how your results align with your original objectives.

## Future Work

Incorporate time-series / seasonal trends

Use more advanced models (e.g. gradient boosting, deep learning)

Use external data (e.g. local events, weather)

Build a dashboard / interactive web app

Extend to other cities or combine multiple Airbnb datasets
